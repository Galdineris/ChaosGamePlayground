 # THE RULES

 ## HOW TO DO IT
 in 5 simple steps you will not believe!

  * Callout(Chaos Drawing Instructions):
    1. Chose a polygon (a closed chape with 3 sides or more) and draw its vertices as dots on a plane
    2. Pick any point in said plane and trace a imaginary line to anyone of the vertices of the polygon.
    3. Place a new dot in near the middle of the imaginary line.
    4. From this new dot, trace another imaginary line to a random vertice of the polygon.
    5. Repeat steps 3 and 4 until you're satisfied!

 To better understand the chaos game, we must first understand what fractals are.
 Fractals are geometric figures which are self-similar, which means parts of them repeats themselfs throughout the figure. In the case of fractals, this repetition is virtually infinite!
 The Chaos Game is just one of the so-called "iterated function systems", algorithms which are capable of generating fractals.
